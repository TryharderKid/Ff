What This Script Does
Information Collection:

Collects the user's Roblox username, display name, and user ID
Gets their hardware ID (HWID) using various executor functions
Retrieves their client ID from Roblox
Identifies which executor they're using
Gets information about the game they're playing
Whitelist String Generation:

Creates a unique identifier string in the format: Lurnai_[HWID]_[UserID]_[ClientID]_[Username]_[Executor]_[MachineID]_[PersitineID]
This string serves as a unique identifier for each user
Secure Obfuscation:

Takes the whitelist string and applies a complex obfuscation algorithm
Adds timestamps and verification data to prevent tampering
Makes it much harder for users to fake or modify their whitelist data
Discord Webhook:

Sends all this information to your Discord webhook
Formats it nicely with embeds showing user info and whitelist data
Allows you to see who is trying to use your script
Local File Creation:

Creates a file called "Whitelist_System.lua" on the user's computer
This file contains both the original and obfuscated whitelist strings
Can be used by your main script to verify if the user is whitelisted
How to Use This for Whitelisting
This script is just the data collection part of a whitelist system. To actually whitelist users, you would:

Collect Whitelist Data:

Have users run this script
It will send their information to your Discord webhook
Create a Whitelist Database:

Create a file (like the "Whitelist_Users.Lua" mentioned in your original script)
Add the whitelist strings of approved users to this file
Host this file on GitHub or another accessible location
Implement Whitelist Checking:

Your main script would:
Generate the user's whitelist string
Compare it to the list of approved whitelist strings
Allow access only if the user's string is in the approved list
Example Workflow
User runs this script
You receive their information in your Discord server
If you decide to whitelist them, you add their whitelist string to your database
When they run your main script, it checks if their string is in the database
If it is, they get access; if not, they're blocked
